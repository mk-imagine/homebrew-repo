# pCloud Drive Homebrew Tap

This tap contains pCloud Drive, which was rejected as an official homebrew formula because it were deemed too difficult to maintain, so this tap will be maintained by me personally.

Tap this repo:
```bash
brew tap mk-imagine/repo
```

## Program(s)

pCloud Drive v3.15.5 UNIVERSAL
```bash
brew install --cask pcloud-drive
```

## Credits

Base formula comes from: https://github.com/tomgross/homebrew-pcloud
