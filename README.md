# pCloud Drive Homebrew Tap

This tap contains pCloud Drive, which was rejected as an official homebrew formula because it were deemed too difficult to maintain, so this tap will be maintained by me personally.

Tap this repo:
```bash
brew tap mkim797/repo
```

## Program(s)

pCloud Drive
```bash
brew install --cask pcloud-drive
```
