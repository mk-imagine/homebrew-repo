# Homebrew Tap

A tap for homebrew; this tap contains program(s) that were rejected as official homebrew formulae because they were deemed too difficult to maintain, so this tap will be maintained by me personally.

Tap this repo:
```bash
brew tap mkim797/repo
```

## Program(s)

pCloud Drive
```bash
brew install --cask pcloud-drive
```
